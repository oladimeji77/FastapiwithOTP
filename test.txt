Final Thoughts
If your API makes external API calls or database queries, use async to handle more users at once.
FastAPI is built for async, so take advantage of it!
For best performance, use httpx (for API calls) and async SQLAlchemy (for database).

Key Takeaways
Feature	        Synchronous (Blocking)	                    Asynchronous (Non-blocking)
Execution       Speed	Slower (waits for each task)	    Faster (tasks run in parallel)
Scaling	        Not efficient for multiple requests	        Handles many requests efficiently
API Calls	    requests.get() (blocking)	                httpx.AsyncClient().get() (non-blocking)
DB Queries	    session.query() (blocking)	                await session.execute() (non-blocking)
